# Campfire Overhaul - TODO

## Fire-Starting Methods Improvements

### 1. [ ] Upgrade Bow to Bow Drill
- Create a proper Bow Drill item (similar to Hand Drill)
- Recipe: Bow + Stick + Plank (or similar)
- Should replace raw bow usage for fire starting
- Better success rate than Hand Drill (~40%)

### 2. [ ] Fix Vanilla Unlit Campfire Bug
- Vanilla unlit campfire not lighting up properly
- Investigate the issue and implement fix

### 3. [ ] Improve Hand Drill Texture
- Current texture is auto-resized from 1024x1024
- Create proper 16x16 pixel art texture
- Should match Minecraft vanilla aesthetic better
